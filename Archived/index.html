        <h1>My Story</h1>
        <div>
          <p>
            Based in Jakarta, I am a Product Manager dedicated to building tech
            that creates real value. I've spent the last 3+ years supervising
            product development and launching industry-first financial tools.
            Previously I have worked in various roles, specifically within
            Islamic Finance, I have since focused building products that impacts
            and benefits people.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love the "0-to-1" phase—figuring out how to build products that
            people actually trust and enjoy using. While my roots are in
            financial innovation, I am currently doubling down on my technical
            skills to become a more versatile builder in the wider tech
            landscape.

            <h2>Ensuring Business Impact</h2>
            <p>
              My strongest asset is a "business-first" mindset. Coming from a
              background in economics and finance, I build solutions that ensure
              long-term viability and move the needle for the organization.

            <h2>Strategic Zero-to-One Products</h2>
            <p>
              Most of my career has been spent in the "blank page" phase. I
              specialize in navigating the ambiguity of early-stage products,
              from launching mobile banking apps from scratch to building
              operations for new ventures.

            <h2>Continuous Growth</h2>
            <p>
              I am a builder who always upskills. I’m currently deepening my
              technical toolkit in engineering to bridge the gap between product
              and engineering, ensuring I can contribute as both a strategist
              and a hands-on partner.
